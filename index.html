                <h3>Was religion important to early colonists? Give examples of why or why not?</h3>
                <p>Yes, religion was very important. The transcript states it was "one of the most constant and important things for many of these peoples" and that it "dictated their decisions."</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Why it was important:</strong> Many colonists came to "freely practice their chosen religion without the fear of persecution." Their religious beliefs also provided a framework for understanding the world, such as blaming livestock death or child mortality on Satan or an "angry god" rather than disease.</li>
                    <li><strong>Examples of its importance:</strong> The Salem Witch Trials and the religious revival known as the Great Awakening are given as examples of how religious fear and fervor manifested in the colonies.</li>

                <h3>What role does glory play in the early colonies? How does it lead to conflict?</h3>
                <p>Glory played a role as a motivator for different groups.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Role:</strong> For monarchs, glory meant ensuring a legacy as a powerful ruler with "vast holdings around the world." For colonists, like the Puritans, it meant the glory of "creating a self-sustaining community" based on their doctrine.</li>
                    <li><strong>Conflict:</strong> The conflict arose from "how the glory would be achieved and at what cost." Specifically, as colonies became profitable, imperial rulers in Europe wanted greater control for their own glory and profit, while colonists began to resent this interference from "absentee rulers." This clash of interests planted the seeds for future conflict.</li>

                <h3>Big Idea Question</h3>
                <p><strong>How did natives adapt to their environment? (Answer in at least 4-5 sentences.)</strong></p>
                <p>Native American societies developed distinct ways of life by expertly adapting to their local environments. In the arid Southwest, groups like the Pueblo developed complex irrigation systems to support the cultivation of maize, which allowed for larger populations and permanent settlements. On the Great Plains, tribes like the Sioux adapted to a nomadic lifestyle centered around hunting bison, a practice greatly enhanced by the introduction of the horse. In the woodlands of the Northeast, societies such as the Iroquois used controlled forest burning to clear land for maize agriculture and manage game, establishing stable, matriarchal villages. Meanwhile, in the resource-rich Pacific Northwest, groups like the Chinook relied on fishing and foraging, developing social structures ruled by wealthy families and living in large longhouses.</p>
