                <h3>Was religion important to early colonists? Give examples of why or why not?</h3>
                <p>Yes, religion was very important. The transcript states it was "one of the most constant and important things for many of these peoples" and that it "dictated their decisions."</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Why it was important:</strong> Many colonists came to "freely practice their chosen religion without the fear of persecution." Their religious beliefs also provided a framework for understanding the world, such as blaming livestock death or child mortality on Satan or an "angry god" rather than disease.</li>
                    <li><strong>Examples of its importance:</strong> The Salem Witch Trials and the religious revival known as the Great Awakening are given as examples of how religious fear and fervor manifested in the colonies.</li>

                <h3>What role does glory play in the early colonies? How does it lead to conflict?</h3>
                <p>Glory played a role as a motivator for different groups.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Role:</strong> For monarchs, glory meant ensuring a legacy as a powerful ruler with "vast holdings around the world." For colonists, like the Puritans, it meant the glory of "creating a self-sustaining community" based on their doctrine.</li>
                    <li><strong>Conflict:</strong> The conflict arose from "how the glory would be achieved and at what cost." Specifically, as colonies became profitable, imperial rulers in Europe wanted greater control for their own glory and profit, while colonists began to resent this interference from "absentee rulers." This clash of interests planted the seeds for future conflict.</li>
